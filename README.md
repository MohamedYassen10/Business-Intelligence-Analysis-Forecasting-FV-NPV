# Business Intelligence Analysis: Forecasting, FV, NPV, and A/B Testing

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of **Business Intelligence (BI)** techniques to analyze financial data, including forecasting, future value (FV), net present value (NPV), and A/B testing. The project is implemented in **Power BI** and includes advanced DAX calculations, interactive dashboards, and row-level security (RLS) for data privacy.

## Key Features
- **Forecasting:** Predicted revenue, profit, and units sold over the next 10 years.
- **Future Value (FV):** Calculated FV for 2% and 5% discount rates.
- **Net Present Value (NPV):** Conducted A/B testing to compare projects based on NPV.
- **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Implemented RLS to restrict data access based on user roles.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI:** For data visualization and reporting.
- **DAX:** For advanced calculations (e.g., FV, NPV, forecasting).
- **Excel/CSV:** For data storage and preprocessing.

## Repository Structure
- `/Data`: Contains the datasets used in the project.
- `/PowerBI`: Contains the Power BI file and custom visuals.
- `/DAX`: Contains all DAX measures used in the project.
- `/Documentation`: Contains the project report and presentation.

## How to Use
1. Download the Power BI file from the `/PowerBI` folder.
2. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Connect the data sources (found in `/Data`) if necessary.
4. Explore the dashboards, DAX measures, and RLS implementation.
